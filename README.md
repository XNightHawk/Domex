# Domex - An Amazon Alexa like Smart Home system

This is Domex, a high school project realized in collaboration with [Simone Lorengo](https://github.com/simonelorengo) many years ago in 2015. We built both the smart devices and all the software stack for the creation of distributed, flexible and fault tolerant wireless sensor networks based on the Zigbee protocol.
You can do things such as remotely turn lights on and off, gather sensor data, control heating, add and remove smart devices on the fly, look at historical data through the web portal and so on.
